# CSharpFun
so far we have been doing class work using c sharp
first we defined an object and wrote its properties and methods together
then we defined or set the blueprint of our own class
we created some basic methods and console writelines and ran our program returning information that we asked for.
at one point i did run into a build and task error that pertained to my .json files
after some seacrching and guidance from instructor i was able to fidure out the problem
we added a new folder to our project called lessons
in that folder we added Numeric Types; this is where we learned the different numeric types and their expressions
we also performed bool statements and ran the program to recieve an output
during this step
